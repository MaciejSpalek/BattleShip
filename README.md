 ## About the project 
The BattleShip is a classical game from childhood.
Firstly draw the map, click play button and try to beat computer, but it's not so easy, as it might seems. The application has two main algorithms: the first one is for setting ship's position and the second one is for computerâ€™s move as an opponent.

 ## Main algorithms 

```javascript
function createShip(array, shipPart, shipNumber, hiddenShip) {...}
```
```javascript
function computerAlgorithm(array) {...}
```
 ## The project created with 
 * HTML

 * CSS + SASS
 * JS + jQuery
 * Responsive Web Design
